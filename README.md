# FadeSlideShow
Image slider with a Fade(in/Out) transition

This is site made for a class project promoting a fictional product; Way Case by Double North.

I created this Image slider as a background to the home page. My intent was to have a new image transition every 4-6 seconds and have the new image fade-in.
